CVPR2023, Multi-Granularity Archaeological Dating of Chinese Bronze Dings Based on a Knowledge-Guided Relation Graph

We introduce a bronze ding dataset with rich archaeological labels. To address the challenges, we construct an end-to-end multihead network for predicting the era of bronze dings based on an AKG. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed network in comparison to existing multi- and single-granularity FGVC methods.
